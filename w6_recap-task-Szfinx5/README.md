# Recap Tasks - Testing üß™

Happy Bank Holiday weekend! It's important to rest and spend time with friends and family, but we also don't want your coding or problem solving skills to get rusty, and we want to make the most of time. For the following tasks, aim to spend at least one hour each day of the long weekend working on them.

## Solidify your testing knowledge üîé

### Continue from the week

We went over a lot of testing knowledge and tools this week, including Jest, Cypress, and Supertest.

If you haven't finished the workshops from this week, make a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) from your pair's repository and continue working them through.

### Test a full stack app

If you're happy with the workshops, have time left over, and are ready for some more practice, we have a full-stack application in this repository (in relevant [front-end](front-end/) and [back-end](back-end/) folders).

To run the app:

- `npm i` and then run your front end in one terminal (navigating to the front end folder).
- `npm i`, add your Heroku credentials in a `.env`, and then run your back end in a different terminal (navigating to the back end folder). You can add a terminal with the + button on the top right of your terminal.

#### Integration test with Cypress

üëâ First, have a play with the app itself in [front-end](front-end/) so you can make a plan of the behaviors you want to test with Cypress.

üëâ Draft your test statements. Start with the basics, and work your way up. Remember to plan out each stage of logic within each test itself - don't start coding until you have a plan for that individual test.

üëâ Then write the tests for each test statement you drafted.

#### Test the back end API with Supertest

üëâ Look at the CRUD routes in the [back-end](back-end/) and plan how you'd test each one using SuperTest.

üëâ Test each route one by one.

## Get ready for React ‚öõÔ∏è

We'll be diving into React next week, and we'd like you to do a bit of reading and watching so you can be ready to hit the ground running. The following links and videos will walk you through the basics of what React is, why we'd want to use it, and what's happening under the hood.

Please read/watch these before class. You don't need to memorize all the details or learn it all by heart! This is your first exposure so you'll have a foundation for when we cover these concepts together.
